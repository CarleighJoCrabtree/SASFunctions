# About Me

Hi I'm Carleigh Jo! I'm a Technical Training Consultant at SAS. I began my career delivering SAS courses to customers, and I've loved being part of their learning journeys. That experience sparked my passion for projects, research, and creativity, which led me to transition to Content Development. In this role, I create eLearning and instructor-led training materials for SAS courses, blogs, workshops and more!

I'm especially passionate about making data and the SAS language accessible and actionable- this focus drives my work every day. My expertise lies in programming in SAS 9 and SAS Viya. 

Outside the office, you'll find me baking, taking art lessons, exploring new restaurants, or traveling. Thank you for your time and attention in the session!
